              %p
                I would generally be on a lookout for experience - in terms of internships & jobs.

              %p
                I would mainly be looking for web development projects/jobs in general to brush up Ruby on Rails skills, if possible with flexible hours. 

              %p
                In the meantime, I would also be looking for jobs to work with experienced web development freelancers, and then gradually move towards freelancing in the future.
            %p
              %b What did you think about the program?
              %p
                I generally think that this program is super beneficial to any new programmers that has a basic background in software development. University students like me would find it enriching and an eye-opener especially towards job prospects in the future (I didn't know freelancing was another option aside from having corporate career).

              %p
                It was fun to meet new programmers and work together in a team to create an awesome solution that would benefit the people.

              %p
                Oh and I think that some basics about Javascripts should be included as well."
