              %p
                I would generally be on a lookout for experience - in terms of internships & jobs.

              %p
                I would mainly be looking for web development projects/jobs in general to brush up Ruby on Rails skills, if possible with flexible hours. 

              %p
                In the meantime, I would also be looking for jobs to work with experienced web development freelancers, and then gradually move towards freelancing in the future.
            %p
              %b What did you think about the program?
              %p
                I generally think that this program is super beneficial to any new programmers that has a basic background in software development. University students like me would find it enriching and an eye-opener especially towards job prospects in the future (I didn't know freelancing was another option aside from having corporate career).

              %p
                It was fun to meet new programmers and work together in a team to create an awesome solution that would benefit the people.

              %p
                Oh and I think that some basics about Javascripts should be included as well."
            %p
              %b What are your aspirations?
              %p
                %p
                  I want to continue building stuff (code, preferably, but there might be other physical projects too) and travel the world at the same time. I'd want to live with simplicity; just like the main characters in the travelling show ""Two Greedy Italians""... link if haven't heard of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvZ1w_oPvJk
                %p
                  I would also want to be part of projects (not necessarily software-based) that improves the lives of humans better and the environment.
                %p
                  I want to learn Japanese, Thai, Spanish and Portuguese as well; either because I have a particular interest in the language, or it's part of my heritage.
                %p
                  Another aspiration I have is to experience university life overseas... but it's not really something that I would undertake super soon. One of those ""might do, but not set in stone""."
            %p
              %b What would you say to someone that is interested to join this program
              %p
                %p
                  You need to make sure you can commit 3 months of your time into learning and building projects, or else, don't apply. Wait for the next intake. On the first day, come up with a simple website idea (can be static pages at first, but it would get complex as you go) and implement the lessons learnt there. 
                %p
                  Start self-learning about Git. If you have only ever used Windows your whole life, start dual-booting your PC to have Linux. It's AWESOME (especially Ubuntu, but I've only had Ubuntu so far).""
                %p
                  University students in the first or second year should give this program a shot. Also, students who have just graduated from school or are seeking courses in web development to learn latest/industry tools used by professionals. Lastly, anyone who has a deep deep desire to learn how webpages should be interested to join this program."

              %p
                I would most probably be looking for a company job as a transition from university into the working field and gain experience.

              %p
                Once I feel confident or when there is an opportunity, I would take other freelancing jobs on the side. I would also very much like to be a part of a startup company.
            %p
              %b What did you think about the program?
              %p
                It was inspiring and an eye opener to know the work flow and process involved in developing a mobile application. It was an opportunity to make valuable connections. Moreover, the track was at a good pace where it challenged us but was not too overwhelming.

              %b What are your aspirations?
              %p
                %p
                  I would like to develop a application that would impact people and the environment.
                %p
                  Travel across the world and code along side people from other cultures and background.

                  Definitely something you won't want to miss if you are able to commit your time. Expect it to be challenging but fun. I would think all final year students and even fresh graduates would be interested to join this program.

                  Learn by doing can understand faster. It gets even better when being taught by good mentor. This program is a combination of both.

                The program is very interesting, except have to reschedule all my usual plan to suits my university and this program timetable. Other than that, it is too cool to be true. The instructors, members and the MAGIC staffs, all of them give such a lot of encouragement and hard work towards this program. I need to thank all of them, a lot.

                  I'll highly recommend it to those who are interested to join. The participants should have some good logic and programming skills as well as the ability to learn something new, fast.For that matter i think this program is suitable  for IT or entrepreneur enthusiast.
