        %b What did you think about the program?
        %p
          It is a very good program for university students as this teaches them the real life skills and not purely theories. Personally I benefited a lot from the program learning how to build web application through rails. It is helping me achieve what I want which is to apply the knowledge but not just learning the theories which is what universities are doing.

          %p
            Be an inspiration to more people so that they take charge of their life and don't let working in the corporate/job to limit themselves.

        %b What would you say to someone that is interested to join this program
        %p
          %p
            By all means, join the program as they will be benefiting a lot from the program. I don't think there is much preparation needed as I am not from a strong programming background but I survived it. Just be ready to sacrifice your time to really master the skill.
